        period: "2014-2015: The Beginning",
        text: "GROBOTS was born in a small university workshop with just five passionate engineering students who shared a common dream: to build robots that could compete on the world stage. Our first project, a 1-pound combat robot named 'Sparky,' taught us the fundamentals of mechanical design, electronics integration, and the importance of rigorous testing. Despite limited resources, we managed to place third in our first regional competition, igniting a passion that would drive us for years to come.\n\nThose early days were characterized by long nights in the lab, learning everything from scratch â€“ from CAD design to motor control algorithms. We made countless mistakes, burned through numerous components, and faced seemingly impossible deadlines. But each failure taught us valuable lessons that would shape our approach to engineering excellence.",

        period: "2016-2017: Building Momentum",
        text: "With our first taste of success, we expanded our team and ambitions. We built our first heavyweight robot, 'Thunder,' which dominated regional competitions and earned us a spot at the national championships. This period marked our transition from hobbyists to serious competitors. We established our first formal partnerships with local machine shops and began developing the engineering processes that would become our foundation.\n\nThe team grew to fifteen members, each bringing unique skills in mechanical engineering, electrical systems, and software development. We won our first national championship in the 12-pound weight class and secured our first major sponsorship, allowing us to invest in better equipment and more ambitious projects.",

        period: "2018-2019: Innovation Era",
        text: "Armed with experience and resources, we entered what we call our 'Innovation Era.' We began experimenting with advanced materials like titanium and carbon fiber, developed our first autonomous navigation systems, and started exploring applications beyond combat robotics. Our breakthrough came with 'Phoenix,' an autonomous robot that won the university's innovation award and attracted attention from industry partners.\n\nDuring this period, we also launched our educational outreach program, visiting local high schools and inspiring the next generation of engineers. We organized our first 'Robot Wars' workshop series, which has since become an annual tradition that reaches over 200 students each year.",

        period: "2020-2021: Adaptation and Growth",
        text: "The global pandemic presented unprecedented challenges, forcing us to adapt our collaborative approach to engineering. Remote work became the norm, pushing us to develop new project management systems and virtual collaboration tools. Surprisingly, this period became one of our most innovative, as we had time to focus on fundamental research and development.\n\nWe launched three major projects during this time: an autonomous security patrol robot for campus safety, a precision manipulation system for laboratory automation, and our fastest racing robot to date. The security robot, 'Sentinel,' was deployed on our university campus and successfully operated for over six months, proving the viability of autonomous security systems. This real-world deployment generated valuable data and led to our first patent applications.",

Our team grew to over sixty active members across five specialized divisions: Combat Robotics, Autonomous Systems, Industrial Automation, Research & Development, and Operations. We moved into a state-of-the-art 5,000 square foot facility equipped with professional-grade manufacturing equipment.\n\nThis period saw our most significant achievements: winning the BattleBots college championship, securing contracts with three major technology companies, and publishing our first peer-reviewed research papers. We also established the GROBOTS Alumni Network, connecting our graduates working at leading robotics companies worldwide.",

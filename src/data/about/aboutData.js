    content: [
      {
        period: "2014-2015: The Foundation Years",
        text: "GROBOTS was born in a small university workshop with just five passionate engineering students who shared a common dream: to build robots that could compete on the world stage. Our first project, a 1-pound combat robot named 'Sparky,' taught us the fundamentals of mechanical design, electronics integration, and the importance of rigorous testing. Despite limited resources, we managed to place third in our first regional competition, igniting a passion that would drive us for years to come.\n\nThose early days were characterized by long nights in the lab, learning everything from scratch â€“ from CAD design to motor control algorithms. We made countless mistakes, burned through numerous components, and faced seemingly impossible deadlines. But each failure taught us valuable lessons that would shape our approach to engineering excellence."
      },
      {
        period: "2016-2017: Building Momentum",
        text: "As word spread about our achievements, our team grew to fifteen members, each bringing unique skills and perspectives. This period marked our transition from hobbyist builders to serious competitors. We invested in professional-grade equipment, established partnerships with local machine shops, and developed our first standardized design processes.\n\nOur breakthrough came with 'Thunder Strike,' a 12-pound combat robot that dominated the regional circuit, winning four consecutive competitions. The success brought media attention and our first corporate sponsors, providing the financial foundation needed to pursue more ambitious projects. We also established our first outreach program, visiting local high schools to inspire the next generation of engineers."
      },
      {
        period: "2018-2019: Expanding Horizons", 
        text: "Recognition of our competitive success opened doors to new opportunities beyond combat robotics. We diversified into autonomous systems, developing our first self-navigating robot for a DARPA-sponsored competition. This venture into AI and machine learning required us to recruit computer science students and establish collaborations with the university's AI research lab.\n\nThe development of 'Navigator Alpha' marked our entry into serious robotics research. Equipped with LIDAR sensors and computer vision systems, it could map unknown environments and navigate complex obstacle courses. While we didn't win that first autonomous competition, the experience laid the groundwork for future success and established our reputation in the broader robotics community."
      },
      {
        period: "2020-2021: Innovation Under Pressure",
        text: "The global pandemic presented unprecedented challenges, forcing us to adapt our collaborative approach to engineering. Remote work became the norm, pushing us to develop new project management systems and virtual collaboration tools. Surprisingly, this period became one of our most innovative, as we had time to focus on fundamental research and development.\n\nWe launched three major projects during this time: an autonomous security patrol robot for campus safety, a precision manipulation system for laboratory automation, and our fastest racing robot to date. The security robot, 'Sentinel,' was deployed on our university campus and successfully operated for over six months, proving the viability of autonomous security systems. This real-world deployment generated valuable data and led to our first patent applications."

      {
        period: "2022-2023: Scaling New Heights",
        text: "As restrictions lifted, we emerged stronger and more focused than ever. Our team had grown to over forty active members, requiring us to establish specialized sub-teams for different project categories. We formalized our training programs, created comprehensive documentation systems, and established partnerships with industry leaders.\n\nThis period saw our greatest competitive successes, including championship victories in three different robotics categories. Our heavyweight combat robot 'Titan Destroyer' dominated the national circuit, while our autonomous navigation system won international recognition at IEEE competitions. The combination of competitive success and practical applications attracted significant funding from both government grants and private investors."
